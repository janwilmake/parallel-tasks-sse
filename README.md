This implementation creates a comprehensive task management system with the following features:

## Architecture

- **TaskManager DO**: Main durable object that stores all tasks, events, and results in SQLite
- **TaskStreamer DO**: Handles individual task creation and SSE streaming, one instance per task
- **Static HTML**: Served from public folder for the main interface

## Key Features

1. **Task Creation**: Users can create tasks by providing API key, processor type, and input
2. **Real-time Events**: SSE events are captured and stored for each task
3. **Task List**: Shows all tasks with status, can be clicked to view details
4. **Task Details**: Individual task pages show complete event history and results as JSON
5. **Auto-refresh**: Task list updates every 5 seconds automatically

## Database Schema

- `tasks`: Stores task metadata and status
- `task_events`: Stores all SSE events received for each task
- `task_results`: Stores final results when tasks complete

## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/tasks`: Create new task
- `GET /api/tasks`: List all tasks
- `GET /api/tasks/{id}`: Get specific task data
- `GET /task/{id}`: HTML page showing task details

The system handles all Parallel API interactions including task creation with SSE enabled, event streaming, and final result retrieval. All data is persisted in the TaskManager durable object's SQLite database.
